title: SSO with SAML
description: Implementing Single Sign-On (SSO) using SAML in Marmotte.
---

Single Sign-On (SSO) allows users to sign into multiple applications with a single set of credentials. Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an open standard that facilitates this by transmitting authentication tokens between an identity provider (IdP) and a service provider (SP). Marmotte offers SAML-based SSO to enhance user convenience and security. Here's how to set it up:

## **Prerequisites**
Before you start, ensure you have:
- Administrator access to Marmotte.
- Access to an identity provider (IdP) like Okta, Auth0, or Azure AD.
- SAML 2.0 details from your IdP.

## **Step-by-step Guide**

### 1. **Marmotte Configuration**

1. **Access SSO Settings**: Navigate to the `Settings` menu in Marmotte and select `SSO/SAML Configuration`.
2. **Enable SAML-based SSO**: Check the box to enable SSO using SAML.
3. **Provide Configuration Details**: Here, you'll need to input the SAML details from your IdP, which typically include:
   - `Entity ID`
   - `Single Sign-On Service URL`
   - `Single Logout Service URL`
   - `x.509 Certificate`

4. **Save the Configuration**: Once all details are provided, save the configuration.

### 2. **IdP Configuration**

The exact steps can vary based on your IdP. However, here is a general outline:

1. **Create a New Application**: Go to your IdP's dashboard and create a new application for Marmotte.
2. **Configuration**:
   - Specify the `Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL`. This will typically be the endpoint where Marmotte expects to receive SAML assertions from the IdP.
   - Specify the `Entity ID` or `Audience URI` which matches the one provided in Marmotte.
   - Set the name ID format to `emailAddress`.

3. **Assign Users/Groups**: Specify which users or groups should have access to Marmotte through SSO.

### 3. **Test the SSO Setup**

After both Marmotte and the IdP have been configured:

1. Try accessing Marmotte. You should be redirected to your IdP's login page.
2. After authenticating with the IdP, you should be seamlessly logged into Marmotte.

## **Advantages of SSO with SAML in Marmotte**

- **Convenience**: Users have fewer passwords to remember and manage.
- **Enhanced Security**: Reduces the risks associated with password-related breaches.
- **Centralized Authentication**: Manage and monitor authentications from a central location, making user management more streamlined.

## **Conclusion**

Integrating SSO with SAML in Marmotte not only provides a more seamless user experience but also elevates the platform's security standards. Ensure regular audits of the SSO setup to maintain its integrity and update configurations as needed.
