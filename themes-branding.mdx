Branding is more than just a logo; it's about creating a consistent look and feel that reflects your organization's identity. Marmotte provides features that allow you to customize its appearance to align closely with your brand's theme. Here's how you can make Marmotte truly yours:

## **1. Logo Customization**

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to the `Settings` menu.
2. Under the `Branding` section, find the `Logo` option.
3. Upload your company's logo. Ideally, use a PNG or SVG format for best results.
4. Save changes and view your logo at the top left of the Marmotte dashboard.

**Note**: Ensure your logo is of a suitable size and resolution so it appears crisp and clear.

## **2. Color Scheme**

Marmotte allows you to change the primary and secondary colors to match your brand's theme.

**Steps**:
1. In `Settings`, go to the `Branding` section.
2. Locate the `Color Customization` options.
3. Choose your primary and secondary colors using the color picker or by entering the HEX/RGB values.
4. Save your changes. The new colors will reflect immediately.

## **3. Custom Domain**

To achieve a more professional look and provide a recognizable link to your users, you can point a custom domain to your Marmotte instance. This requires some configuration on the DNS settings of your domain provider, especially if you're self-hosting the open-source version of Marmotte.

**Steps**:
1. Choose the domain or subdomain you wish to use for Marmotte.
2. Update your domain's DNS settings:
   - If you're pointing the entire domain to Marmotte, set up an `A record` pointing to the IP address where Marmotte is deployed.
   - For subdomains, configure a `CNAME record` pointing to your primary domain.
3. Once set, it might take some time (up to 48 hours) for DNS changes to propagate across the internet. After this period, your Marmotte instance should be accessible via your chosen domain.

## **4. Login Page Customization**

Personalize the login page to make it recognizable to your team members.

**Steps**:
1. Under `Settings` and `Branding`, find the `Login Page` options.
2. Customize the background, add any welcome text or instructions, and upload any relevant images.
3. Save changes to see them reflected on the login page.

## **5. User Interface Customization**

Adjust the overall look and feel of the Marmotte interface by choosing from various themes and layouts.

**Steps**:
1. Go to `Settings` and then `User Interface`.
2. Choose from the available themes and layouts to adjust the interface as per your preference.
3. Save changes for them to take effect.

Remember, while branding is crucial for identity and recognition, ensuring usability and functionality remains paramount. A balanced approach to branding will ensure both your team and stakeholders have a seamless and memorable experience with Marmotte.
