description: Integrating GitHub authentication in Marmotte.
---

In order to integrate GitHub authentication into your Marmotte application, you'll need to make use of the configuration present in the `config/services.php` file. This setup allows users to log in using their GitHub credentials.

## Configuration Content:
```php
    'github' => [
        'client_id' => env('GITHUB_CLIENT_ID'),
        'client_secret' => env('GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET'),
        'redirect' => env('GITHUB_REDIRECT_URL'),
    ],
```
## Understanding the Configuration:

- **`client_id`**: This represents the ID of your GitHub application. You'll get this ID when you register your application with GitHub.

- **`client_secret`**: This is the secret key associated with your GitHub application. It's essential to keep this value confidential as it's used to authenticate your application's requests to the GitHub API.

- **`redirect`**: This URL is where GitHub will send the user after they've granted/denied permission to your application. It should match one of the URLs you provided when registering your application on GitHub.

## How to Use:

1. Register your application on GitHub to obtain your `client_id` and `client_secret`.
2. Update your `.env` file with the appropriate values:
```php
    GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id_here
    GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret_here
    GITHUB_REDIRECT_URL=http://yourdomain.com/your-redirect-endpoint
```
3. In your Marmotte application, use the Socialite package to initiate the authentication flow. Once authenticated, GitHub will redirect the user to the specified `redirect` URL with the user's details.

## Note:

Make sure that your `redirect` URL matches one of the callback URLs specified in your GitHub application settings to ensure the OAuth flow works seamlessly.

By incorporating GitHub authentication, you provide your users with a seamless way to log in using their existing GitHub credentials, enhancing their user experience and streamlining the registration process.
