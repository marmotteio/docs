In Marmotte, the asset management landscape is broken down into various models. These models represent distinct entities in your IT infrastructure, ranging from tangible assets like hardware to intangible assets and associations like licenses and contracts. By understanding and utilizing these models, organizations can achieve a holistic view of their assets, optimize their usage, and derive maximum value.

## Understanding the Asset Models

Here’s an overview of each model and its significance:

- **Users**: Represents individual users within the organization. They might be employees, IT personnel, or even external collaborators.

- **Hardware**: Covers physical devices like laptops, servers, networking equipment, and more. Keeping track ensures that no device is underutilized or overextended.

- **Suppliers**: Entities or companies that provide your organization with assets. By maintaining a record, you can ensure timely procurement, renewals, and service.

- **Manufacturers**: Companies that produce the hardware and software assets you utilize. This can be crucial for warranty claims, updates, and support.

- **Components**: Physical parts or software modules that constitute or complement your hardware.

- **Consumables**: Items like ink cartridges, cables, or any other replaceable items used in the IT infrastructure.

- **Contracts**: Legal agreements related to your assets, perhaps maintenance contracts, leasing, or licensing.

- **Licences**: Software licenses that your organization owns. It’s crucial to track these to prevent compliance issues.

- **Maintenances**: Scheduled or unscheduled maintenance activities on hardware or software assets.

- **Depreciations**: Represents the reducing value of an asset over time, helping in financial and replacement planning.

- **People**: External entities like consultants or contractors who might have temporary access to your assets.

- **Locations**: Physical locations where your assets reside, be it office buildings, data centers, or remote sites.

## Optimizing Your Asset Usage

1. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review all the assets under each model. Ensure that no asset remains idle or underutilized.

2. **Maintain Updated Records**: As assets undergo changes - be it hardware upgrades, software updates, or location shifts - update the records in real-time.

3. **Monitor Depreciations**: Understand when an asset is nearing the end of its productive life. Plan its replacement or upgrade ahead of time.

4. **License Compliance**: Regularly check the `Licences` model to ensure that your software licenses are in compliance and there are no unauthorized usages.

5. **Contract Renewals**: Use the `Contracts` model to keep track of contract expiration dates. This ensures timely renewals and prevents service disruptions.

6. **Leverage Data Insights**: Analyze the data across models to identify trends, inefficiencies, and opportunities. For instance, if a specific hardware frequently needs components replaced, it might be more cost-effective to replace the hardware.

7. **Manage Vendor Relationships**: Use the `Suppliers` and `Manufacturers` models to streamline communications, negotiate better deals, and ensure timely support.
