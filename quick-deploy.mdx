Welcome to the Quick-Deploy guide for Marmotte. This tutorial will walk you through deploying Marmotte using Docker, a platform that simplifies software deployment in containers. By the end of this guide, you'll have Marmotte running in a Docker container on your machine.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, ensure you have:

1. **Docker** installed on your machine. If you haven't, visit [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started) to download and install it.
2. Basic familiarity with terminal or command prompt commands.

## Steps to Deploy

### 1. Pull the Marmotte Docker Image

Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following command:

```bash
docker pull marmotteio/marmotteio:latest
```

This command will download the latest Marmotte image from Docker Hub.

### 2. Run Marmotte in a Docker Container

After the image is successfully pulled, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 5959:8000 \
    --name marmotteio \
    -e APP_NAME=Marmotte.io \
    -e APP_ENV=local \
    -e APP_DEBUG=true \
    -e APP_URL=http://0.0.0.0:5959 \
    -e DB_CONNECTION=sqlite \
    -e DB_DATABASE=/app/marmotte.sqlite \
    -e DB_FOREIGN_KEYS=true \
    -v $(pwd):/app \
    marmotteio/marmotteio:latest
```

After the Docker container is running, you can open your favorite browser and head over to:

```bash
http://localhost:5959
```

And that's it! You now have Marmotte running in a Docker container on your machine. This method is especially useful for quick deployments, testing, or even for production scenarios if configured properly.

Note: Do remember to adjust the Docker command as per your requirements, particularly if you need to pass in environment variables, link to databases, or make any other configuration changes.

### Viewing Logs and Managing the Docker Container

Once Marmotte is running within a Docker container, there might be scenarios where you need to view logs in real-time, or you might want to stop the container. Here's how you can do that:

To tail the logs in real-time for your running container, use the following command:

```bash
docker logs -f marmotteio
```

To stop the Marmotte Docker container:

```bash
docker stop marmotteio
```
