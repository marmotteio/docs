Webhooks serve as connectors between Marmotte and other platforms, facilitating real-time communication. By defining webhooks, you can ensure that specific actions within Marmotte instantly initiate or notify activities in external applications.

## Configuring Webhooks

To begin setting up webhooks:

1. Navigate to the top left corner and select the "Team's" menu.
2. Choose the "Webhooks" page from the dropdown.
3. Here, you have the capability to manage existing webhooks and add new ones.

### Adding a New Webhook

1. Click on "Add New Webhook" or a similar option.
2. A form will appear, prompting you for the webhook's specifics:

   - **Method**: Decide the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, etc.) the webhook will employ when contacting the designated URL.
   - **URL**: Provide the endpoint URL for Marmotte to send the webhook data to.
   - **Number of Retries**: Specify how many times Marmotte should try to resend the webhook data if it doesn't receive a successful response (2XX status code).
   - **Action**: Choose which actions will trigger the webhook: Create, Update, and/or Delete.
   - **Model**: Indicate the model (like Resource, License, etc.) related to the action that will activate the webhook.

3. Save your settings.

## Webhook Data Format

When a webhook is activated, Marmotte dispatches data in a standardized JSON format. Here's a generic outline of the payload:
```json
    {
       "event": "model.action",
       "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS",
       "data": {
          "id": "unique_id_of_the_item",
          "attributes": {
             ... // Model specific data attributes
          }
       }
    }
```
- **event**: A combination of the model and the action, for instance, "resource.create".
- **timestamp**: The precise moment when the event took place.
- **data**: Houses relevant details about the item that invoked the webhook.

## Webhook Retries

Should there be response failures from the endpoint, Marmotte will retry based on the "Number of Retries" you've determined. This ensures that temporary network issues don't result in missed data transmissions.

## Managing and Testing Webhooks

After adding a webhook:

- **Edit**: You can always revisit the Webhooks page to modify or update your webhook configurations.
- **Delete**: Remove webhooks that are redundant or if endpoints have changed.
- **Test**: It's best practice to test new webhooks to ensure they function as expected. Use the "Test" function to dispatch a sample request to the provided URL.

## Use Cases and Benefits

With webhooks, you can:

- Get real-time notifications in other systems or applications when specific events occur in Marmotte.
- Start workflows in different platforms based on data changes in Marmotte.
- Synchronize data between Marmotte and other tools your team utilizes.

Harness the capabilities of webhooks to make Marmotte an integrated component of your IT asset management operations. By effectively using this feature, you can extend Marmotte's functionalities, adding even greater value to your asset management processes.
