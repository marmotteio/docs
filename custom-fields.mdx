To make Marmotte even more adaptable to your IT asset management requirements, we offer the ability to add custom fields. These fields let you capture specific data points that aren't part of the default setup.

## Types of Custom Fields

Choose from three distinct types of custom fields to fit your data capture needs:

1. **Text**: Perfect for brief descriptive data such as unique IDs, labels, or short notes.
2. **Date**: Ideal for date-centric information, like purchase dates, expiry dates, or maintenance schedules.
3. **Number**: Meant for numerical data points like quantities, serial numbers, or monetary values.

## Models Supporting Custom Fields

Custom fields can be related to the following models:

- **Hardware**
- **Component**
- **Consumable**
- **License**
- **Depreciation**
- **Department**
- **Manufacturer**
- **Supplier**
- **Person**

This adaptability ensures comprehensive data capture across various asset categories.

## How to Add a Custom Field

1. From the main dashboard, navigate to the left-hand side menu.
2. Click on "Custom Fields" to access the list of all existing custom fields.
3. Select "Add Custom Field" to open the custom field form.
4. Fill out the form:
   - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for your custom field.
   - **Type**: Choose between Text, Date, or Number.
   - **Related Model**: Select the model to which this field should be related (e.g., Hardware, License, etc.).
5. Confirm and save your changes.

Once added, your custom field will be available when adding or editing items within the chosen model.

## Best Practices for Custom Fields

- **Be Descriptive with Field Names**: Ensure the custom field's name precisely captures its intent.
- **Avoid Duplication**: Before adding a new custom field, ensure a similar field doesn't already exist to prevent redundancy.
- **Regularly Review Custom Fields**: As your asset management requirements change, revisit and update your custom fields to stay relevant.
