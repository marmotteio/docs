description: Stay ahead with real-time notifications and alerts for crucial IT asset changes in Marmotte.

In the dynamic world of IT asset management, staying proactive is key. With Marmotte's Notifications and Alerts system, you're always informed about critical changes, especially when certain assets fall below their specified thresholds.

## Models Supporting Notifications and Alerts

The following models come equipped with the notifications and alerts feature:

- **License**
- **Component**
- **Consumable**

For each of these models, two essential columns are pivotal for this feature:

1. **Quantity**: Indicates the current number of the asset.
2. **Threshold**: The predefined number at which an alert should be triggered if the quantity goes at or below it.

## Setting up Alerts

1. Navigate to the specific model (e.g., License, Component, Consumable).
2. Either add a new item or choose to edit an existing one.
3. In the form, you'll find the "Quantity" and "Threshold" fields. Fill in the desired numbers.
4. Save your changes.

Now, whenever the quantity for that particular asset reaches or drops below the specified threshold, Marmotte will trigger an alert.

## How Alerts Work

### On Marmotte:

If any asset's quantity goes at or below its set threshold:

1. An alert will be raised.
2. You can view these alerts by clicking on the "Alert" page from the left navigation menu.

### External Notifications:

Apart from the in-app alerts, Marmotte can also notify team members through external channels:

1. **Discord**: Notifications will be sent through a specified Discord webhook.
2. **Slack**: Notifications will be pushed through a designated Slack webhook.

## Setting up Discord and Slack Webhooks

1. Navigate to the top left and click on "Team Settings."
2. Locate the section for webhook configurations.
3. Input your Discord or Slack webhook URLs as required.
4. Save the settings.

Once set up, Marmotte will automatically push notifications to the specified channels in Discord or Slack whenever an alert condition is met.

## Staying Proactive

Regularly check the "Alert" page and configure your notifications to ensure that you're always ahead and can act proactively to replenish or manage your IT assets effectively.
